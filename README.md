This repository contains all the necessary files and links for the STAT545B Assignment B-3 and B-4.
  - For assignment B-3, I chose option B and includes the following features:
    - An input to select the region
    - A plot that is populated by the region selection
    - A background image of a grizzly
  - For assignment B-4, I chose option 3 and includes the following features:
    - A region input selection as well as a 2nd parameter input that adjusts the y variable
    - 3 different plots that react to the region and parameter inputs
    - A new background image and a smaller thumbnail in the sidebar
    - Improved layout and brief instructions for the user
    - Link to the original data set

The shiny app detailed here provides users a glimpse at the BC Gov 2019 dataset on Grizzly Bear conservation efforts. In particular it provides users with a plot of population size estimates, female population size, and threat level per region within BC. To navigate the plot, use the Parameter and Region selection tools on the left-hand side.
