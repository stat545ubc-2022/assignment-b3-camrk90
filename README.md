The shiny app detailed here provides users a glimpse at the BC Gov 2019 dataset on Grizzly Bear conservation efforts. In particular it provides users with a plot of population size estimates, female population size, and threat level per region within BC. To navigate the plot, use the Parameter and Region selection tools on the left-hand side.
