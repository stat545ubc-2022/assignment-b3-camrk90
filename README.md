This repository contains all the necessary files and links for the STAT545B Assignment B-3.
  - For this assignment, I choose Option B. 

The shiny app detailed here provides users a glimpse at the BC Gov 2019 dataset on Grizzly Bear conservation efforts, in particular it provides users with a plot of population size estimates per region within BC. To navigate the plot, use the Region select tool on the left-hand side. 

To access the app, use this link: https://crkelsey.shinyapps.io/2018_BC_Grizzly_Conservation/

The dataset used to this app can be found on the BC Gov website at the following link: https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/grizzly-bear-conservation-ranking-results
