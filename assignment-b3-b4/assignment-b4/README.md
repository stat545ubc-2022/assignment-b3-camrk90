This repository contains all the necessary files and links for the STAT545B Assignment B-4.
  - For this assignment, I choose Option 3. 

The shiny app detailed here updates the app from assignment B3. It adds a few extra features such as:
- A parameter input with 3 options
- 3 different plots that correspond to the parameter input
- A new background and tidier layout
- Brief instructions for the user

To access the app, use this link: https://crkelsey.shinyapps.io/2018_BC_Grizzly_Conservation/

The dataset used to this app can be found on the BC Gov website at the following link: https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/grizzly-bear-conservation-ranking-results

Thanks for looking!
